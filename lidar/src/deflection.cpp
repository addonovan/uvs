 * Calculate the deflection component derived from this one reading. This is 
 * applied to each and every (valid) reading that the sensor reads. Each
 * component is then combined and weighted with a function based on its angle,
 * thus these can all be knee-jerk reactions, but they will probably get 
 * smoothed out.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - reading.angle is an int within [-180, 180]
 * - reading.angle is 0.0 for readings directly in front of the rover 
 * - positive angles are to the rover's right
 *   negative angles are to the rover's left
 * - reading.distance is a int measuring centimeters
 * - reading.distance will not be below about 15 cm
